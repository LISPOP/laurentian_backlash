## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Tests

1. Write a paragraph of text about your hometown. Add some bolding and some italics.
2. Add a code chunk to make a graph of something in the `mtcars` data set. Use the `ggplot` command. Load the `tidyverse` library
3. Add a bulleted list of things you're going to do in the next little while like grocery shopping or whatever.
4. Add a new section header with `##
5.Go up to the `YAML` content section and change the output of the document from `html` to `pdf`
